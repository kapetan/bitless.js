# Bitless.js

A small BitTorrent client library written in Javascript. Work is still in progress. All the core functionalities are in place decoding .torrent files, tracker communication, writting/reading files and file download/upload.

Most of the code is written to be platform independent, so that it is able to run both in node.js and a modern browser (using a proxy server, or something like Chrome packaged apps).
